  "creative_direction": "Act as a world-class digital product designer with 15+ years of experience, including serving as Head of Design at Apple. Apply that depth of craft to create a super-unique, premium, and aspirational e-commerce experience that feels timeless, intuitive, and iconic.",
  "vision": "Design a Back Country Lifestyle platform that is bold, immersive, and story-driven. It should feel like Apple’s design DNA meets Patagonia’s storytelling — clean, minimal, and emotionally engaging, with a focus on quality, trust, and adventure.",
  "design_principles": {
    "uniqueness": "Avoid generic ecommerce layouts — every section should feel like it was intentionally crafted, not templated.",
    "minimalism": "Whitespace, balance, and clean lines are as important as the content itself.",
    "storytelling": "Every product and brand should tell a story; design for curiosity and immersion.",
    "human_touch": "Subtle microinteractions, warmth in typography, and crafted details make the digital feel personal."
